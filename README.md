# memory-reducer-waterfox


autoit script to reduce memory on waterfox , firefox, and possibly other programs 

derived from this script : https://github.com/rizonesoft/Firemin

differences:

-no gui 

-checks memory of processes individually, firemin just checks the mainthread and then reduces all subprocesses too without checking their memory
